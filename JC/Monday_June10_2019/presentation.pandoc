Place cells â†’ "Encodes the position of the animal in its environment"

# Two major roles of Hippocampus 

1. Spatial cognitive maps and navigation
   - Some place cells fire only when animal is in one particular location
  (single field place cells)


2. Episodic (_who, what, when, where, etc._) and declarative memory

This paper,

> Reconciles these two dominant, but apparently different points of view.

# Hippocampus as spatial cognitive maps (place cells), but

- A signle neuron often (always?) participate in multiple tasks
  - Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition, Fusi et. al.,
    2014
  - Barlow versus Hebb: When is it time to abandon the notion of feature
    detectors and adopt the cell assembly as the unit of cognition?, Eichenbaum
    2017

- Activity of a single neuron is highly variable in time
  - Long-term dynamics of CA1 hippocampal place codes, Ziv et. al., 2013
  - Place cell discharge is extremely variable during individual passes of the
    rat through the firing field, Fenton et. al., 1998

- Activity of a single neuron can be modulated by multiple variables

# Hippocampus in this paper

- Acts as a memory device: store many correlated patterns.
- Spatial tuning (place cells) is an emergent property.

# Hippocampus as a storage device

Q: What is a good strategy (to increase the capapcity) to store many correlated
patterns? 

A: __Remove redundancy__ Extract uncorrelated components and store them.

# Compressing sensory inputs experienced during navigation (simulation)

![ \scriptsize Schematic of a rodent exploring an open field arena. 
 (b): Schematic of the architecture of the network with potential mapping of the layers onto
 entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. 
 (c): The memory capacity (the number of stored inputs that can be 
 recalled from noisy cues of overlap < 0.7, such that
 the pattern overlap of the retrieved representation with the original stored
 pattern is larger than 0.8) as a function of the number of training sessions
 (exposures to the environment).

# Single neuron properties: the emergence of place cells

![ \scriptsize __(a,b)__ Trajectories of a simulated animal in an open arena (exploration
statistics A; top), and the spatial tuning profiles emerging from training the
auto-encoder network on an artificial sensory input corresponding to these
trajectories (bottom) for 36 neurons randomly selected from the second (dentate
gyrus-like) layer of the model.  __(c,d)__ Same as on the left, but for a set of
trajectories with a slightly different exploration bias (exploration statistics
B).

# History effects and the ability to decode the recent past

![\footnotesize (c) the fluctuations of the previous two panels are not just
noise, but reliably capture history-dependent information,... one can decode 
from the neural (DG) representations of the simulated animal exploring an 
environment not just the statistics of the current session (i.e., A versus B;
green), but also the statistics of the previous session it experienced (purple).
