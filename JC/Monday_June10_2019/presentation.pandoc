Place cells â†’ "Encodes the position of the animal in its environment"

# Roles of Hippocampus 

- Spatial cognitive maps and navigation
- Role in episodic (_who, what, when, where, etc._) and declarative memory

This paper,

> Reconciles these two dominant, but apparently different points of view.

# Hippocampus as spatial cognitive maps (place cells)

because, __some place cells fire only when animal is in one particular location
  (single field place cells)__

# Hippocampus as spatial cognitive maps (place cells), but

- A signle neuron often (always?) participate in multiple tasks
  - Why neurons mix: high dimensionality for higher cognition, Fusi et. al.,
    2014
  - Barlow versus Hebb: When is it time to abandon the notion of feature
    detectors and adopt the cell assembly as the unit of cognition?, Eichenbaum
    2017

- Activity of a single neuron is highly variable in time
  - Long-term dynamics of CA1 hippocampal place codes, Ziv et. al., 2013
  - Place cell discharge is extremely variable during individual passes of the
    rat through the firing field, Fenton et. al., 1998

- Activity of a single neuron can be modulated by multiple variables

# Hippocampus in this paper

- Acts as a memory device: store many correlated patterns.
- Spatial tuning (place cells) is an emergent property.
- has place cells which shows history effects

# Hippocampus as a storage device

Q: What is a good strategy (to increase the capapcity) to store many correlated
patterns? 

A: __Remove redundancy__ Extract uncorrelated components and store them.
